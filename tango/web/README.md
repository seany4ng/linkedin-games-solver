# Tango: Frontend

We use a React/Typescript frontend with vite for building the project. Before starting, make sure your npm and node versions are supported. The dependencies will generally require:
- `node -v` >= 16.18
- `npm -v` >= 8.3

If these requirements are satisfied, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And open the app locally in a browser:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

**Note: this requires starting the backend server first. See `../core` for details.**
